# LightMind UI Framework - Architectural Decisions

## Decision Log

### #001 - Base Framework Choice
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Decision**: Use shadcn/ui as foundation  
**Rationale**: 
- Proven copy-paste model gives full control
- Already built on solid foundations (Radix UI + Tailwind)
- Large community and ecosystem
- Avoids vendor lock-in while providing standardization

**Alternatives Considered**: Building from scratch, Chakra UI, Material UI
**Trade-offs**: Some initial setup overhead vs. long-term flexibility

### #002 - Monorepo Strategy
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Decision**: Use Turborepo for monorepo management  
**Rationale**:
- Fast builds with intelligent caching
- Easy package management and dependency sharing
- Simple configuration and great DX
- Strong Next.js integration

**Alternatives Considered**: Lerna, Nx, Rush
**Trade-offs**: Simpler but less feature-rich than Nx

### #003 - Component Distribution Model
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Decision**: Hybrid copy-paste + npm package approach  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains shadcn/ui's copy-paste flexibility
- Provides npm package for common workflows
- Allows gradual adoption and customization
- Supports both approaches based on user needs

**Alternatives Considered**: Pure npm package, pure copy-paste
**Trade-offs**: More complex build pipeline vs. maximum flexibility

### #004 - Backward Compatibility Strategy
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Decision**: Additive-only changes with optional props  
**Rationale**:
- Never break existing code
- Use optional props for new features
- Provide deprecation warnings before removal
- Clear migration guides for major changes

**Implementation**: 
- All new features use optional props
- Existing props maintain exact same behavior
- New modes/variants as additional options

### #005 - Visual Testing Approach
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Decision**: Integrate Browser MCP for automated visual testing  
**Rationale**:
- Automated cross-browser validation
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Accessibility auditing integration
- Real-time visual feedback during development

**Alternatives Considered**: Manual testing, Storybook with Chromatic
**Trade-offs**: Additional complexity vs. comprehensive automation

### #006 - Component Gallery Search Strategy
**Date**: January 14, 2025  
**Decision**: Multi-faceted search with filters  
**Rationale**:
- Search by name, description, and use case
- Filter by category, complexity, and features
- Tag-based organization for flexibility
- Real-time search results

**Implementation**:
- Fuzzy search for component names and descriptions
- Category filters (form, navigation, display, etc.)
- Feature filters (accessibility level, complexity)
- Live preview with copy-paste functionality

## Future Decisions Needed
- Deployment strategy (Cloudflare Workers vs. Vercel)
- Package naming conventions
- Versioning strategy for components
- Community contribution guidelines
- Documentation hosting approach
