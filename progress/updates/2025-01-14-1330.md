# Progress Update #3 - Live Component Gallery & Examples
**Time**: 1:30 PM - 2:00 PM  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Status**: Component Gallery Complete, Examples Built

## Completed Tasks
âœ… Created live component preview system with actual shadcn/ui components  
âœ… Built comprehensive example pages showing real-world usage  
âœ… Implemented preview registry for dynamic component loading  
âœ… Created Button, Card, and Input components with full variants  
âœ… Built dashboard, form, and settings examples  
âœ… Started development server successfully  

## Current Focus
ðŸ”„ Integrating browser MCP for visual testing  
ðŸ”„ Adding more essential components (Dialog, Select, Label)  
ðŸ”„ Polishing the overall experience  

## Key Achievements
- Gallery shows live, interactive component previews
- Example pages demonstrate real-world usage patterns
- Clean component architecture following shadcn/ui patterns
- Responsive design with proper accessibility considerations

## Technical Progress
- Component gallery with live previews: âœ… Complete
- Example pages (dashboard, forms, settings): âœ… Complete
- Component preview system: âœ… Complete
- Development environment: âœ… Running

## Gallery Features Delivered
- **Live Component Previews**: Actual interactive components, not mockups
- **Code Copy-Paste**: One-click copying of component code
- **Multiple View Modes**: Grid and list views for browsing
- **Advanced Filtering**: By category, complexity, and features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search across components

## Example Pages Delivered
- **Dashboard Example**: Stats cards, charts placeholder, recent activity
